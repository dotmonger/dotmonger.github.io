Incremental Games
=================
_Posted: 28 December 2016_

As I wrote on my intro, I really like minimalistic yet beautiful game. And my current favorite is [A Dark Room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com). I can't stressed enaugh how much its inspire me. Its simple yet mysterious, highly accessible due its web based nature, "What the" kind of a story, beautiful folding revelation.

In fact, few days ago I just discovered that there were some other games that fall into the same category as A Dark Room (which I pretty much suspected were inspired by it). It happened that people mostly called this kind of games as "Incremental Game", due its nature of revealing its gameplay part after part. If you like these kind of game, I suggest to try some the ones listed here : www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/wiki/list_of_incremental_games . But for your reference, I'll listed some that happen to cam to my liking:

- [Candy Box](http://candies.aniwey.net/) : The original inspiration to 'A Dark Room'. Downright crazy yet funny.
- [Speed Warp](http://speed-warp.net) : Some of the few that really fall into the same category as 'A Dark Room' & 'Candy Box'. Entirely text-based (note the usage of ASCII art), truly unfolding interfaces as the game progress, completely mysterious gameplay. A must try
- [True Exponential](http://angarg12.github.io/TrueExponential/) : To be honest, I haven't really understand much about what this game about, and I haven't explored it far enough. But the idea of using Mathematical Research theme along with it LaTeX styled design, its really interesting.
- [Drowning In Problems](http://game.notch.net/drowning/) : Interesting example about using Incremental Game mechanics on themes regarding everyday life. I think this is some the few incremental game that really try to convey story in repetitous, monotonous, grind-all-the-way style of Incremental Game, rather than giving some mystery with no actual meaning on it.

Yeah, its really few, but I think this is enough for now. I'll try to review some more when I have tried some more games on the list I've given above. Anyway, enjoy the games.
