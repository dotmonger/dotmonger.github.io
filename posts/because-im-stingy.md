Because Im Stingy

I've been longing to make a blog on github pages for a long time. So, when last night I've decided to make my new blog there, I was pretty much dissappointed knowing that to make a decent blog there I need to use some third-party static-page generator such as Jekyll. So than an idea crossed my mind, "Is there a way to do Github blogging, using markdown file managment, without any need to install anything?". Its turns out, there is a way: using browser based AJAX query + Markdown parser.

So the idea is pretty simple: Use a one-page web, powered with javascript, and use it to load Markdown files hosted on github pages and than convert it into HTML in the client's side. This way, we could do some blogging in github without any need to install any static-website generator. Heck, we dont even need to install git as currently Github support file creation on the website!

Neat huh?

So how do we do it? To answer that, you'll need some more patience as it seems I could write it down some other time.

Anyway, thanks for being curious. :D
