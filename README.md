## Welcome My Page

Hi, I'm Dotmonger, a crazy freelance web developer from Bandung, Indonesia. I mostly worked with back-end development such as PHP, CMS, MySQL, etc. But other than my work, I'm highly interested with beautiful minimalist game (specially, [A Dark Room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com) ), along with discussion about Artifical Intelligence. I'm also a huge fan of reading mangas and novels.

Thanks for visiting!
